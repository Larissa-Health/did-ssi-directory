# The open SSI / DID Directory

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** This directory is here for all of us to learn. You do not have to be technical to contribute, but we expect you to do your research before you contribute. We are blockchain agnostic. **This is no place for hate ❤️**&#x20;

You can present your project, but make sure it is not a commercial and you follow the

* [Code of Conduct](CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md)
* [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
{% endhint %}



DID and SSI are still very young technologies and yet to be explored. &#x20;

We have found that the information is scattered all over the place. As a newbie, there is no easy place to just dive in, explore the topic and inform yourself about the project groups working on it. This directory aims to solve this issue.

We welcome everybody to be curious and to join our effort.

### First Steps

Follow our handy guides to get started on the basics as quickly as possible:

{% content-ref url="fundamentals/did-in-a-nutshell.md" %}

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="fundamentals/ssi-in-a-nutshell.md" %}
[ssi-in-a-nutshell.md](fundamentals/ssi-in-a-nutshell.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="fundamentals/scientific-foundation/" %}
[scientific-foundation](fundamentals/scientific-foundation/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Good to know:** your product docs aren't just a reference of all your features! use them to encourage folks to perform certain actions and discover the value in your product.

### Fundamentals: Dive a little deeper

Learn the fundamentals of MyProduct to get a deeper understanding of our main features:

{% content-ref url="fundamentals/scientific-foundation/task-lists.md" %}

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="fundamentals/scientific-foundation/tasks.md" %}
[tasks.md](fundamentals/scientific-foundation/tasks.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**Good to know:** Splitting your product into fundamental concepts, objects, or areas can be a great way to let readers deep dive into the concepts that matter most to them. Combine guides with this approach to 'fundamentals' and you're well on your way to great documentation!
