**Important:** This directory is here for all of us to learn. You do not have to be technical to contribute, but we expect you to do your research before you contribute. We are blockchain agnostic. **This is no place for hate. Be kind and forgiving. ❤️**&#x20;

You can present your project, but make sure it is not a commercial and you follow the

* [Code of Conduct](CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md)
* [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
{% endhint %}

DID and SSI are still very young technologies and yet to be explored. &#x20;

We have found that the information is scattered all over the place. As a newbie, there is no easy place to just dive in, explore the topic and inform yourself about the project groups working on it. This directory aims to solve this issue.

We welcome everybody to be curious and to join our effort.
