# ION

{% hint style="info" %}
ION is an open, public, permissionless Layer 2 Decentralized Identifier network that runs atop the Bitcoin blockchain
{% endhint %}

### Decentralized

ION is a Layer 2 open, permissionless network based on the purely deterministic Sidetree protocol, which requires no special tokens, trusted validators, or additional consensus mechanisms; the linear progression of Bitcoin's timechain is all that's required for its operation.

### Scalable

ION is designed for scale, supporting thousands of DID operations per second across the network. ION is based on a strongly eventually consistent architecture that enables embarrassingly parallel ingest, processing, and resolution of DID operations.

### Censorship & Tamper Evasive

* ION DIDs can only be deactivated by their owners, protecting people from violations of digital rights.
* ION includes registry capabilities to support decentralized package managers, app stores, etc.
* ION enables DID owners to securely connect to each other through decentralized routing endpoints.
