# Blocktrust

Blocktrust develops wallets, products and tools around Atala PRISM. The technological focus is on .net based solutions. Currently, three proposals are under development:

### Blocktrust identity wallet

A browser extension wallet to manage, issue and share credentials from within the browser. Making credentials and DIDs available in the browser and enabling interaction with websites is essential to the future growth of PRISM. Just as Metamask pioneered the crypto wallet, the blocktrust identity wallet aspires to do the same for web-based SSI.

A video of the current state of development and further details can be found here: [https://blocktrust.dev/IdentityWallet](https://blocktrust.dev/IdentityWallet)

### PRISM analytics platform

As the adoption of Atala PRISM accelerates, so does the need to understand how the network is growing. Who is using it? And how is it being utilized? The blocktrust analytics platform tries to answer these questions. But in particular, it tries to visualize trust chains. How does trust propagate? How does trust build from the bottom up? Based on data directly from the blockchain this web-based solutions offers a live view behind the curtain on how PRISM works. It offers statistical data and tools to better understand on what is happening when DIDs and VCs are created.

A POC of the product can be found here: [https://analytics.blocktrust.dev](https://analytics.blocktrust.dev/)

### Web credentials

Many types of credentials don't become truly powerful until they are publicly accessible. When we think of SSI, we think first of privacy, of independent control over one's credentials—but this is only part of the equation. Endorsements and reviews only get their benefits from the fact that anyone can see and verify them. Blocktrust web credentials is all about making these credentials visible. It provides a toolkit to embed credentials on web pages and make them verifiable for third parties with just one click.
