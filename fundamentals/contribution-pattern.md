If you see something that needs correction or could be explained better go forward and request a change ðŸ‘€ðŸŽ‰

Head over to **Blockchain & Projects,** and please proceed in the following pattern.

Blockchains and projects should be sorted in alphabetical order.

If your Project is already handling cross-platform then add your project to the platform you mainly operate on. After that you add only the name in the [cross-platform-projects.md](../blockchains-and-projects/cross-platform-projects.md "mention")and link it to the different blockchains using GitBook's links.&#x20;
