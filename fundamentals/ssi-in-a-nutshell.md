# SSI in a nutshell



Self-sovereign Identity describes a concept that allows the user to share only the minimum amount of data needed to receive a specific service.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** If you want to visit a bar, the doorman doesn't need your birthday, not even your age. He only needs to know if you are old enough to visit a bar. In today's world, you might show your driver's license or ID card. Both of them disclose unnecessary data to the doorman.
{% endhint %}

A self-sovereign architecture for managing verifiable claims is one in which an end-user is in complete control of their identifier, where the verifiable claims are contained, and how they are used. This architecture will need a wallet to hold your credentials.

#### The current standard for expressing and transacting verifiable claims&#x20;

Self-sovereign and privacy-enhancing standards haven't found a common baseline that is strong enough to receive sufficient adoption.
