# Contributing to the DID / SSI Directory

üëçüéâFirst of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute!üéâüëç

You do not have to be a tech-pro to contribute.  
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this open directory.  
Hosted in [Larissa.Health](https://github.com/Larissa-Health/did-ssi-directory) on GitHub.  
Co-curated with [GitBook](https://gitbook.com).  
These are mostly guidelines, not rules.  
Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/Larissa-Health/did-ssi-directory/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## I don't want to read all of this, I just have question!

Please check out our [Discussions section](https://github.com/Larissa-Health/did-ssi-directory/discussions). 
Maybe you find a thread that answers your questions. 
If not, feel free to [open a new thread](https://github.com/Larissa-Health/did-ssi-directory/discussions/new) and explain what you are wondering about. 
And then there is a multitude of other channels specific to your project.

Discussions are also the place to talk about your ideas on how to improve the portal and engage with developers and contributors.

## Project structure

Make yourself familiar with the [Project Structure](https://github.com/Larissa-Health/did-ssi-directory/blob/main/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md). 

We try to keep everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. 
If you see something that could be improved, you are encouraged to raise an issue wherein you propose your changes and explain the rationale.

## Project Showcase

The project showcase should be a place where someone new to the ecosystem can come to see what can be done - it should not be seen as a database where every project is promoted.

### Adding your own project

Read the **requirements** and follow the **instructions** in the guide of 
[How to Showcase Your Project](https://github.com/Larissa-Health/did-ssi-directory/blob/main/SHOWCASE_YOUR_PRODUCT.md).

#### A word about project descriptions

We understand that you burn for your product, but try to stay objective.  
Descriptions help users find a project they are interested in and decide whether to visit the links you provided.  
Use relevant keywords and describe what your project is all about or what it does.  
Don't include claims in your description like *the **best** wallet*, *the **first** ABC* or *the **only** XYZ*.  
We will ask you to change the description in your pull request before merging. @TODO rationale?

## Ideas 

This section features ideas that show people what issues could be solved with DID / SSI.  
If you add an idea, elaborate and keep room for discussion.  
Remember the space is still young, and we all are still learning. 
Did we mention to be kind?  

## Pull Requests

To maintain the quality of content in the directory, we use pull requests to integrate changes from contributors. 

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](https://github.com/Larissa-Health/did-ssi-directory/blob/main/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](https://github.com/Larissa-Health/did-ssi-directory/blob/main/STYLEGUIDE.md)  
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track and resolve that problem.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
